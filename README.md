### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the `_posts` directory by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

The following is a post file with different configurations you can add as an example:

```sh
---
layout: post
title: Welcome to Jekyll!
featured: true
tags: [frontpage, jekyll, blog]
image: '/images/welcome.jpg'
---
```

You can set the author, featured or not, tags, and the post image.

The `featured` key is to mark the post as a featured post, this will add a simple star icon (*) to the postcard.

To keep things more organized, add post images to **/images/pages** directory, and add page images to **/images/pages** directory.

To create a draft post, create the post file under the **_drafts** directory, and you can find more information at [Working with Drafts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/).

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).

Note that tags are not working with GitHub Pages, that's because the used [jekyll-tagging
](https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging) plugin is not [whitelisted](https://pages.github.com/versions/) by GitHub.

To make this work, I use [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment.

### Pages

To create a new page, just create a new markdown file inside the `_pages` directory.

The following is the `about.md` file that you can find as an example included in the theme with the configurations you can set.

```sh
---
layout: page
title: About
image: '/images/pages/about.jpeg'
---
```

Things you can change are: `title` and `image` path.


### Navigation

The navigation on the sidebar will automatically include all the links to the pages you have created.
